Place the WR Stats executable in your Elma folder.

The program will look for your state.dat, and automatically updates as you play the game.

If no state.dat is present, it will instead look for stats.txt, but this does not automatically update.

If none of these are present, you will get an error message.

The program will automatically download necessary data-files (wr-stats_tables.csv and wr-stats_targets.csv) on start-up.

If your connection is offline at the time of opening the program, it will look for local copies and use those instead.

The WR tables are updated daily, so there may be an up to 24 hour delay between new tables on Moposite and updates to the program's datafiles.
